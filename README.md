## Frontend
1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the frontend directory by running the following command: 
cd frontend
3. Install the project dependencies by running:
npm install
4. Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server by running:
npm run dev
5. Your frontend should now be running locally. You can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000` by default. Any changes you make to the frontend code will automatically hot-reload, allowing you to see the updates in real-time.

## Backend
1. Open a new terminal window (or tab).
2. Navigate to the server directory by running the following command:
cd server
3. Install the project dependencies by running:
npm install
4. Once the installation is complete, start the backend server by running:
5. Your backend server should now be running locally. It will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` by default, but please refer to your project's documentation for the specific endpoint.

Now, both your frontend and backend should be up and running, and you can start working on your project.

Happy coding!
